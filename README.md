# Open Schoology
A basic Google Chrome extension to open Schoology.

**As of now, the CRX Method doesn't work, for more information please see the [Notices](#notice), until then please use the [Zip](#zip-method) method.**

## What is it?
It is a basic Google Chrome Extension, build in HTML 5, and CSS 3, it was made in 5 minutes, and very sloppy and rushed. I wil be trying to make it more visually appealing, and more efficient to use, in the near future.


### How to install
##### ~~CRX Method (Recommended)~~
Download the CRX file from the GitHub Releases tab, go to the Chrome Extensions page, open the folder containing the newly downloaded CRX file, drag and drop the file anywhere on the extensions page, it may say there's an error, please see the [Notices](#notice)
##### Zip Method
Download it from GitHub Releases tab, extract the .zip file, go to the Chrome Extensions page, enable developer mode, Load Unpacked, go to the extracted zip file, and click on the root directory of which the files of the extension are stored, and click Open Folder.

### Notice
- After installing the extension using the Zip Method, there is a chance that it will say there is an error, this is false, please disregard that.
- CRX Method doesn't work as of now, because I don't have access to the web store, I will work on getting access.
